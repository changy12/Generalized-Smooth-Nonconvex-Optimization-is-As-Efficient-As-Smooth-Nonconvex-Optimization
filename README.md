# Generalized-Smooth-Nonconvex-Optimization-is-As-Efficient-As-Smooth-Nonconvex-Optimization

This code is for the ICML 2023 paper titled: Generalized-Smooth Nonconvex Optimization is As Efficient As Smooth Nonconvex Optimizations

Simply run “PhaseRetrieval.py”. A new folder called “Phase_results” will be created. Then in this folder, the code will the two result figures for phase retrieval as well as “hyperparameters.txt” which records the hyperparameters of all algorithms. 

Simply run "DRO.py". A new folder called “DRO_results” will be created. Then in this folder, the code will the two result figures for distributionally robust optimization (DRO) as well as “hyperparameters.txt” which records the hyperparameters of all algorithms. 

Python version: 3.9
