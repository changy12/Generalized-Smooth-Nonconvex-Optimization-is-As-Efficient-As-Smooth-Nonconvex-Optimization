# Generalized-Smooth-Nonconvex-Optimization-is-As-Efficient-As-Smooth-Nonconvex-Optimization

This code is for the paper: Generalized-Smooth Nonconvex Optimization is As Efficient As Smooth Nonconvex Optimizations

Simply run “PhaseRetrieval.py”. It will generate the two desired result figures of the phase retrieval experiment in the new folder “Phase_results”, as well as “hyperparameters.txt” which records the hyperparameters of all algorithms. 

Simply run "DRO.py". It will generate the two desired result figures of the DRO experiment in the new folder “DRO_results”, along with “hyperparameters.txt” which records the hyperparameters of all algorithms.
